NAME
  peek - Simple screen recorder with an easy to use interface

SYNOPSIS
  peek [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
  Peek makes it easy to create short screencasts of a screen area. It was built
  for the specific use case of recording screen areas, e.g. for easily showing
  UI features of your own apps or for showing a bug in bug reports. With Peek
  you simply place the Peek window over the area you want to record and press
  "Record". Peek is optimized for generating animated GIFs, but you can also
  directly record to WebM if you prefer.

  Peek is not a general purpose screencast app with extended features but rather
  focuses on the single task of creating small, silent screencasts of an area of
  the screen for creating GIF animations or silent WebM videos.
